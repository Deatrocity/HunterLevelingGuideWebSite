		<h1>Professions to consider</h1>
			<img src="pictures/mining.jpg" alt="Picture of a person with a pickaxe" id="floatingpicture">
			<p>There are many professions in World of Warcraft Classic. They all have different benefits, but for leveling up you should
			really only worry about the gathering professions and First Aid.</p>
		<div id="bigtext">
		Skinning
			<ul>
				<li>Skins aren't worth a lot on the auction house, but they vendor for a decent amount. It adds up.</li>
				<li>Skinning is a great profession if this is the first character you have and don't have any gold to help you while leveling up.</li>
				<li>You will need lots of gold leveling up for repairs/new skills/mounts/etc..., vendor your skins to save up.</li>
			</ul>
		Mining
			<ul>
				<li>Mining can be great for saving up money as well.</li>
				<li>Sell ore/bars on auction house, don't vendor them.</li>
				<li>Mining is a good complement to engineering.</li>
			</ul>
		Engineering
			<ul>
				<li>You can make your own bullets!</li>
				<li>There are a ton of gadgets that can help you while leveling up.</li>
				<li>Powerful PvP utility if you are being attacked by other players a lot.</li>
			</ul>
		First Aid
			<ul>
				<li>Mandatory!</li>
				<li>Heal yourself during combat.</li>
				<li>Can often mean life or death during certain encounters!</li>
			</ul>
