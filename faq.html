			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<dl>
				<dt>Do hunters need ammo?</dt>
					<dd>Yes. Unlike other ranged classes that use mana to attack, you will use bullets/arrows.</dd>
				<dt>Why does my pet have a frowny face next to its nameplate?</dt>
					<dd>Your pet is upset from lack of food. Feed them to cheer them up or they'll run away!</dd>
				<dt>I keep running out of mana, how do I restore it faster?</dt>
					<dd>Cary water with you at all times and drink when neccesary. You don't have to use every ability on every enemy.
					Sometimes just auto-attacking with you and your pet will be enough.</dd>
				<dt>When enemies hit me with Aspect of the Cheetah active they daze me and slow me down, should I switch before combat?</dt>
					<dd>You Should always switch to Aspect of the Hawk or Monkey when in combat.</dd>
				<dt>Which pet is best?</dt>
					<dd>It depends on what you need. If you are leveling up by questing, usually a high-damage pet will be best, such as a cat. 
					If you are fighting other players a lot, sometimes it's better to use a pet with more utility such as a boar, who can
					 stun enemies.</dd>
				<dt>Should I quest or grind?</dt>
					<dd>Both. Questing is the primary way of leveling up fast, while keeping you geared up along the way. But there are many 
					enemies you will pass on your way to quest objectives. You should be killing anything that you wont have to go out 
					of your way for.</dd>
