		<h1>PVP tips to help you while leveling up</h1>
			<p>
				Before you make your character, you must choose a server. If you choose a PVP server, you will be
				able to be attacked by players of the opposing factions when in contested zones.<br><br>
				This can make leveling up in a particular area very difficult, so it's good to be prepared!
