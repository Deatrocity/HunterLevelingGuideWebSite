				One thing that makes hunters unique is their pet. Pets are incredibly powerful is WoW Classic. 
				In fact, the two classes that have access to pets are considered the two best classes for leveling; the Hunter
				and the Warlock. Your pet can do all sorts of things for you.<br><br>

		<div id="bigtext">
			Here are some of their uses:
		<ul>
			<li>They can tank enemies, allowing you to avoid damage completely.</li>
			<li>They can chase down enemies trying to flee because of their superior speed.</li>
			<li>They can interrupt enemy spell casters with their fast attack speed.</li>
			<li>You can set them to aggressive behavior, tagging enemies almost instantly as they spawn.</li>
			<li>They can distract enemies if you are in danger and need to make an escape.</li>
		</ul>
			There are three categories of pets.
		<ul>
			<li>Tanks - They will take and absorb the damage, allowing you to do damage from afar.</li>
			<li>DPS - The heavy damage dealers. Will increase your kill speed.</li>
			<li>Utility - They have unique abilities that will help you mostly in PvP encounters.</li>
		</ul>
